# `dockercore/builder-deb`

This image's tags contain the dependencies for building runc `.deb`s for each of the Debian-based platforms runc targets.

To add new tags, see [`contrib/builder/deb` in https://github.com/opencontainers/runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/contrib/builder/deb), specifically the `generate.sh` script, whose usage is described in a comment at the top of the file.
